## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a YouTube dataset using Jupyter Notebook and various data analysis libraries in Python. The goal is to perform data cleaning, explore key statistics, and generate insights about channels, video uploads, grades, views, and subscribers. The analysis addresses a series of questions designed to better understand the dataset's structure and content.

## Key Features
- **Data Exploration**: Display dataset rows and columns, check data types, and get overall statistics.
- **Data Cleaning**: Replace invalid values, handle missing data, and clean specific columns like Rank, Video Uploads, Subscribers, and Grade.
- **Insights & Analysis**: Generate insights about channel performance, including video uploads, views, and subscriber counts.
- **Visualization**: Use Seaborn and Matplotlib to create visualizations that highlight trends and patterns in the dataset.

## Technologies Used
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive coding environment
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Numpy**: Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib**: Plotting and visualizations

## Usage
The notebook answers the following analysis questions:
1. Display All Rows Except the Last 5 Rows Using the head() Method
2. Display All Rows Except the First 5 Rows Using the tail() Method
3. Find the Shape of the Dataset (Number of Rows and Columns)
4. Get Information About the Dataset (Number of Rows, Columns, Datatypes, Memory Requirements)
5. Get Overall Statistics About the Dataframe
6. Data Cleaning: Replace invalid values ('--') with NaN.
7. Check Null Values in the Dataset
8. Data Cleaning: Clean the Rank column.
9. Data Cleaning: Clean the Video Uploads and Subscribers columns.
10. Data Cleaning: Clean the Grade column.
11. Find the Average Views for Each Channel
12. Identify the Top Five Channels with Maximum Video Uploads
13. Find the Correlation Matrix
14. Determine Which Grade Has the Maximum Number of Video Uploads
15. Determine Which Grade Has the Highest Average Views
16. Determine Which Grade Has the Highest Number of Subscribers
17. Determine Which Grade Has the Highest Video Views
## Analysis Questions
This project tackles several analytical questions that aim to explore the dataset in depth, including identifying top channels by uploads, analyzing the impact of grades on views and subscribers, and examining the correlation between different columns.
## Conclusions
Some key takeaways from the analysis include:
- **Top Channels:** Insights on which channels have the most video uploads.
- **Impact of Grade:** Analysis on how the grade of a channel affects video uploads, views, and subscribers.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Exploration of relationships between columns like views, uploads, and subscribers.
